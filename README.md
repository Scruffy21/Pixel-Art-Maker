# Pixel-Art-maker

A project to allow users to draw pixel art on a grid. Made during Google Developer Challenge Scholarship 2017/2018.


So far it supports desktop fully, but touch devices only with a limited functionality. (no painting by dragging on touch devices)


Made in November 2017. (improved a bit since then)
