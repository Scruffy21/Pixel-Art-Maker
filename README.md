# Pixel-Art-maker

A project to allow users to draw pixel art on a grid. Made during Google Developer Challenge Scholarship 2017/2018.


Supports desktop, but touch devices only with a limited functionality. Also not made responsive for different screen sizes.



Made in November 2017. (improved a bit since then)
